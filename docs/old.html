<p>A retrofuturistic programmable pixel machine,
  geared towards low level programming.</p>

<p>It is the sister project of
  <a href="https://90s.dev/" target="_blank">90s.dev</a>.
  In fact I aim to recreate it using HRAM for hyper-efficiency.
</p>

<p>It aims to recreate the experience
  of getting a new programmable computer
  in the 70s or 80s</p>

<p>It ships with a minimal os, shell, and text editor.
  You use these to build it up into an os or anything.</p>

<p>It has core apis for keyboard, mouse, audio,
  timers, procs (os threads), and pixmaps (e.g. the screen).</p>

<p>It's extremely lightweight, written in c/c++,
  using only win32 and directx, and embedded lua 5.5.</p>

<p>It bundles asmjit.dll and lpeg.dll,
  to help you experiment with making a language (optional).</p>




sync

  newthread(fn<string>, ...) -> int|[nil,string]
    creates and returns a thread handle
    extra args are passed to fn
    returns error only on syntax errors

  sleep(ms)
    sleep the current thread for ms milliseconds

  newcritsec() -> int
    return a new critical section

  delcritsec(ms)
    delete a critical section

  entercritsec(ms)
    enter a critical section
    only one thread can enter at a time

  leavecritsec(ms)
    leave a critical section

  closehandle(int)
    frees resources and notifies waiters
    these must be manually closed:
      threads, semaphores



	local sysdata = 0x10000
	local event = sysdata[0]
	local arg = sysdata[4]

	if event == 6 and arg == 122 then
		fullscreen()
